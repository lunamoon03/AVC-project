|10/5/23|Project Plan|Luna/Jacob|13/5/23|Project Plan is done to all active team memberâ€™s satisfaction.|
|10/5/23|Open gate|Luna|13/5/23|Robot is able to open gate|
|12/5/23|Basic movement functions|Luna|17/5/23|Basic functions for movement (move straight for certain distance, turn left/right by certain amount)|
|12/5/23|Basic black line detection|Luna|17/5/23|Robot is able to detect the black line, and ideally move along it enough to get through quadrant 2|
|12/5/23|Hardware prototype|Jesse|20/5/23|Hardware in good enough shape that features can be tested. This is possibly going to be quite difficult|
|15/5/23|Basic code structure/quadrant detection|Jacob|20/5/23|Main function has structure. It also has decision making to switch algorithms depending on quadrant (complex). This also would include moving the camera once in the 4th quadrant to a vertical position|
|17/5/23|Colour detection and movement|Jesse|23/5/23|Robot is able to build on black line detection and movement functions to detect coloured cylinders and move to them.|
|24/5/23|First full test|Full team |24/5/23|Full test of whole course. 1 week before deadline|
|25/5/23|<p>Testing/Polishing/</p><p>Fixing/Patching Week</p>|Full Team|30/5/23|Continue testing, patching issues, and polishing software and hardware before final deadline|
|10/5/23|Finished!|All|31/5/23-3/6/23|Project is completed and ready for final test|
