|12/5/23|Hardware prototype|Jesse|20/5/23|Hardware in good enough shape that features can be tested. This is possibly going to be quite difficult|| |
|15/5/23|Basic code structure/quadrant detection|Jacob|20/5/23|Main function has structure. It also has decision making to switch algorithms depending on quadrant (complex). This also would include moving the camera once in the 4th quadrant to a vertical position|| Main function is currently very clean and well structured. A function to detect when the quadrant change is has been made and will need to be called in quadrant 2 and 3 in order to determine when to move on. The camera move function has not yet been made.  |

##Analysis
Creating the functions to detect colours has worked. Implemeting the camera move function has proved to be more dificult than anticipated with determining how much the camera needs to turn. Main function has remained clean. No function for quadrant 3 has been created yet although many functions which would be used it in has such as branching path detection.

Bottlenecks and things slowing development. One thing slowing development is the difficulty of working with the raspberry pi. Sometimes it won't be accessible via ssh without doing strange work arounds like sshing into barrets first.
